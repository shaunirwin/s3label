A general format of JSON is used which will allow this to work on any platform. 

## Class of Users
The users are split into two tiers: admin and 'labellers'. Segmentation of users allows differentiation between users (admin) that assigns tasks and users ('labellers') that receives tasks.

Instance segmentation allows the user to draw over existing selections.
Once the drawing is done the new selection will not overlap existing selections.
